# Rust_roulette_guessgame
Learning Rust for the first time I wanted to learn guess game a bit deeper so I made a new version of it that is more like playing roulette and let you guess color of numbers as well. This is my revisited version of the original guess game in Rust (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
